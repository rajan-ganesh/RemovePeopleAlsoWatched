## This chrome extension gets rid of the "People Also Watched" Section from YouTube's search page.

I built this as that section made me waste time watching videos I didn't originally go searching for, and resulted in the actual search results being limited to only 5-10, making it difficult to find unpopular videos. 

## Installation

* Download the file from GitHub
* Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions
* Toggle "Developer Mode" on at the top right
* Click "Load Unpacked" at the top left
* Select the downloaded file
* Ensure that the extension is enabled
